This is archaic-ass bingo-card generation code.

#
#  Generate a bingo card from a directory of 95px x 95px images.
#
#  Original idea from Planet Socks "Presidential Debate Bingo"
#  (http://www.planetsocks.com/bingo.asp)
#
#  Rick Bradley (rick@rickbradley.com)
#
#  Drop your collection of PNG files in a directory under the bingo root
#  directory (defaults to RAILS_ROOT + '/public/images/bingo/').  Call the
#  bingo controller with id set to the directory name containing the images
#  (so, for "/public/images/bingo/art/" I'd call /bingo/art/ on the URL line.
#  
#  *.png files are all equally weighted, unless they are named like: foo_#.png,
#  in which case the # is a weight for that image.
#


TODO:

 - characterization tests for the controller & views
 - refactor.
 - hamlize the view
